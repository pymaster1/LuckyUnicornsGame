#a. This should be displayed to the user.  
#b. DECISION:
#i. If the token is a unicorn, the user wins $5, 
#ii. if it is a zebra or horse, they win 50c
#iii.  if it is a donkey then they donâ€™t win anything.
 
#5.  The game should allow players to continue / quit provided they have not lost all of their money. 
#6. It should supply appropriate feedback so that the user knows how much money they have won / lost each round and how much money they have left.
#7. Once students have no more money, the game should end (although players do have the option of quitting while they are ahead)
